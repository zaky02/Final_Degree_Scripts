These are the python scripts used to execute Glide and generate the graphs according to the Glide scores. 

- The prep_lig script prepares the ligands we want to assess through ligprep a software from Schr√∂dinger which gives different 3D conformations 
  to the input ligands by using different torsion angles and different ionic states.

- The grid_setup script sets the receptor grid for our docking with a hydrogen bond and a positional constraint.

- The docking_setup scripts performs the docking of the ligands into the receptor protein and score the docking pose.

- The graphs_glide script generates histograms on the scores obtained by the ligands and scatterplots comparing the scores between LigBuilder and 
  Glide to check for any correlation.
